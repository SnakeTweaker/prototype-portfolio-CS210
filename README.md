# prototype-portfolio-CS210


    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    
        Embedding Python into C++ to read a list and create a structured database from the provided information
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    
        Designing the Python code and implementing ASCII graphics in a console application. Menu design was fairly easy.
    
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    
        Closing the files when the user inputs number 4 (exit) on the prompt. 
        
    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    
        The most challenging piece of the code was designing the histogram. I didn't understand how I was supposed to create it at first. I tried importing different libraries, but the way the C++ source code was set up, it didn't allow it. So instead I created a graph of my own within the program.
    
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    
        Attention to detail. Programming theory, and the ability to understand source code better.
    
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
        
        Industry standard comments and documentation supporting future development and design of the program.
